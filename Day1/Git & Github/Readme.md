# Git & GitHub Session Resources

Welcome to the resources page for the **Git & GitHub** session conducted on [9/30/2024].

## Introduction to Git & GitHub

### What is Git?
Git is a distributed version control system that helps developers track changes in their code over time. It allows multiple developers to collaborate on a project without overwriting each other’s work, making it an essential tool in modern software development.

Key features of Git:
- **Version Control**: Keeps track of all changes made to files in a project.
- **Branching & Merging**: Developers can work on different features or bug fixes in separate branches and merge their work into the main branch once it's complete.
- **Distributed System**: Each developer has a complete copy of the project’s history on their local machine.

### What is GitHub?
GitHub is a cloud-based platform built around Git. It provides a graphical interface for Git and offers several features like project management, collaboration tools, and hosting of code repositories.

Key features of GitHub:
- **Repositories**: Store your project’s files and history.
- **Collaboration**: Teams can work together on projects using features like pull requests, issues, and reviews.
- **Community**: Millions of open-source projects are hosted on GitHub, making it a go-to platform for developers.

### Why Use Git & GitHub?
- **Backup & History**: Never lose your code, and easily roll back to previous versions.
- **Collaboration**: Work with others without overwriting code.
- **Open Source**: Contribute to projects that help millions of people.
